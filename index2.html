          <div class="col-wide job-description">
            <p>How should an environment, a building, a room be used? To explore the personal needs of our customers, we initiate a conversation. This often creates a new way of thinking and expands on the original ideals and vision. 
              A good starting point developing your brief is by going through your existing home and making a list of what works for you and what does not work for you. Time spent at this initial stage is invaluable as a design is only as good as the brief.</p>

            <div class="col-wide job-description">
              <p>When the brief is finalised we will carry out a survey of your site (new builds) or your home (extensions, renovations). We then develop an Initial Design in the form of sketch designs and diagrams.
                  We agree with you the time plan, budget, roles, communications and the services you might require from us.
                  We will advise you on building regulations, the need for specialist consultants or services if required, planning requirements, and health & safety regulations.</p>

            <p>Your feedback on the Initial Design will become part of the Detailed Design for your approval. We will provide you with drawings – including floor plans, elevations (views) and sections (cut-through).
                Other presenting tools we might choose include models and 3-D walk through. This is an important two-way process which will require your feedback and discussion.</p>

              <p>Following planning permission we produce full Construction Drawings, including site works and specification finishes. We also prepare a technical and quality specification to ensure that the project requirements are clearly stated for the contractor.
                  The detailed design will incorporate any changes as required under a Grant of Planning Permission. We will also liaise closely with specialist consultants as required and undertake a review of Building Regulation compliance.</p>

              <p>We prepare tender documentation for main and specialist contractors. It is advisable to have at least three contractors submit costings (tenders) for a project. 
                  We review the contractors and tenders with you and making not that he successful tender may not necessarily be the lowest one. In fact, if a tender is very low, the contractor may have missed something.
                  We will also advise on the most appropriate Form of Building Contract for your project as well as on insurance requirements during construction.</p>
